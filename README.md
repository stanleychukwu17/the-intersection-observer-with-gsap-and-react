## Intersection Observer mini Web-App
I experimented on animating an Element in React where a user scrolls to that element, or when the user scrolls to certain portion of that element(
    e.g if the user scrolls to 80% of a div element, then i will use gsap FadeIn the content of the div element
)

## react-use npm package
For this project, i used a hook from the react-use library, this library is awesome as it has so many useFul hooks that can help with various task on your project
e.g 
useBattery
useGeoLocation 
useKey, useKeyPress, useKeyboardJs, and useKeyPressEvent
useLongPress
useMotion
useMouse
And Plenty more, the link to the package:
[react-use](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use).
